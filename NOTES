- will do cvs repos. later, for now this directory is snapshotted
  nightly to /backup if you need rollback.

- build is now statically compiled with a particular i/o handler, and
  is no longer selectable at runtime.  make aldl-ftdi or aldl-tty.

./aldl-io - any code that does i/o with the aldl port or deals with
  serial interfaces needs to be here.

./consoleif - a console based dashboard display interface

./configfile - parsing system for config files

./error - global error handling routines.  interface-specific errors should
  use their own error handlers.

./misc - miscellaneous code and objects that aren't being used yet

./examples - documentation etc

ADX Files:

nAst1 - the one I use the most for firechicken/fiero
OSE 12p - planned to use with my truck
TGP 8F - 2bar code used in my friend's truck
