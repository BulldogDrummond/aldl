for detailed project overview, see: http://resflter.github.io/aldl

dependancies: libftdi, bison, flex, pthreads

the build is now statically compiled with a serial driver.  right now, the ftdi
driver is the only one supported.  to build: make aldl-ftdi

contents:

main.c: sets up initial structures and spawns some threads, to get things going

acquire.c: an object that runs an event loop full of functions from aldl-io,
           maintaining connection state and constructing a linked list buffer
           of parsed and verified aldl data.

error.c: a global error handling object.

debugif/  a testing display module just to spit out raw data to make sure it's
          working.

aldl-io.h: all public functions are exported here.  this also explicitly
           includes aldl-types.h.

aldl-types.h: defines all public data structures used in this library.

aldldata.c: provides functions for data management, including construction of
            the linked list of records, parsing and conversion of raw data, and
            thread-safe read/write of critical data.

aldlcomm.c: provides communication protocols for dealing with the ECM, including
            sending and generating requests, retrieving raw packets of data,
            and verifying them.

serio-ftdi.c: an object that allows serial communications using the libftdi
              userland driver (via libusb).  this is the reccommended and only
              currently supported interface.

serio-dummy.c: a really stupid fake serial driver for debugging, that pretends
               to be an LT1 ecm.  seriously, it's really stupid, doesn't even
               check input, just spits out data in a serialized operation scope

NOTES:

string to identify your ftdi interface (pick one):
   d:devicenode (usually at /proc/bus/usb)
   i:vendor:product
   i:vendor:product:index
   s:vendor:product:serial
