** in active development, not ready for use **

for detailed project overview, see:

http://resfilter.github.io/aldl

it has various serial interface methods, which it uses to place the ECM in
diagnostic mode, so realtime data can be retrieved, calculated, and then
processed by a series of display or scripting modules.  right now the ftdi
driver is the only one in active development, the others have been removed.

it uses a proprietery config format, which defines the location of various
data sets, and conversion specifications per diagnostic commands, as well
as ecm-specific strings and timing.

a script will be provided to import some of the specs in a tunerpro ADF
file.

it is intended for use on low-power devices such as the raspberry pi, to
construct digital secondary dashboard type devices.

dependancies: libftdi, bison, flex

build is now statically compiled with a particular i/o handler, and is no
longer selectable at runtime.

run following in root directory:

make aldl-ftdi
