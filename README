** in active development, not ready for use **

this is a handler for gm obd-i aldl serial diagnostic systems.

it has various serial interface methods, which it uses to place the ECM in
diagnostic mode, so realtime data can be retrieved, calculated, and then
processed by a series of display or scripting modules.

it uses a proprietery config format, which defines the location of various
data sets, and conversion specifications per diagnostic commands, as well
as ecm-specific strings and timing.

a script will be provided to import some of the specs in a tunerpro ADF
file.

it is intended for use on low-power devices such as the raspberry pi, to
construct digital secondary dashboard type devices.

dependancies: libftdi (reccommended), bison, flex

build is now statically compiled with a particular i/o handler, and is no
longer selectable at runtime.

run following in root directory:

make aldl-ftdi
-or-
make aldl-tty
