** in active development, not ready for use **

this is a handler for gm obd-i aldl serial diagnostic systems.

it has various serial interface methods, which it uses to place the ECM in
diagnostic mode, so realtime data can be retrieved, calculated, and then
processed by a series of display or scripting modules.

it uses a proprietery config format, which defines the location of various
data sets, and conversion specifications per diagnostic commands, as well
as ecm-specific strings and timing.

a script will be provided to import some of the specs in a tunerpro ADF
file.

it is intended for use on low-power devices such as the raspberry pi, to
construct digital secondary dashboard type devices.

dependancies: libftdi (reccommended), bison, flex

- build is now statically compiled with a particular i/o handler, and
  is no longer selectable at runtime.  make aldl-ftdi or aldl-tty.

./aldl-io - any code that does i/o with the aldl port or deals with
  serial interfaces needs to be here.

./consoleif - a console based dashboard display interface

./configfile - parsing system for config files

./error - global error handling routines.  interface-specific errors should
  use their own error handlers.

./misc - miscellaneous code and objects that aren't being used yet

./examples - documentation etc
