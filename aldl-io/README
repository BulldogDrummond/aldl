there will be multiple aldl i/o methods, so far just these two:

tty serial i/o:
  * removed for now

ftdilib:
  * this is a super-portable userspace ftdi chipset driver.  most usb aldl
    cables seem to use that chipset.
  * for the most common usb-serial adaptors, seems to be more powerful and
    can be configured with very specific baud rates, bit banging, advanced
    timing.  this should be the most commonly used.
  * to use it, the ftdi_sio driver must be blacklisted or it'll auto-load
    when the interface is plugged in, and ftdilib wont work.

string to identify your ftdi interface (pick one):
   d:devicenode (usually at /proc/bus/usb)
   i:vendor:product
   i:vendor:product:index
   s:vendor:product:serial

autodetection is activated if the string isn't present.  this is untested, and
simply picks the first available ftdi interface on the bus.

these interfaces are compile-time selected.  object files for each method are
available with an identical api for each method.

Notes on Timing:
the 'timeout' fields are imprecise, and are a minimum timeout only.
