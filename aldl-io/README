this aldl-io library provides every function necessary to communicate with an
8192 baud GM aldl ecm, and create parsed data structures to be used by the
various interfaces in the program.  it does not manage events or connection
state, that must be done with an external event loop.

aldl-io.h: all public functions are exported here.  this also explicitly
           includes aldl-types.h.

aldl-types.h: defines all public data structures used in this library.

aldldata.c: provides functions for data management, including construction of 
            the linked list of records, parsing and conversion of raw data, and
            thread-safe read/write of critical data.

aldlcomm.c: provides communication protocols for dealing with the ECM, including
            sending and generating requests, retrieving raw packets of data,
            and verifying them.

serio-ftdi.c: an object that allows serial communications using the libftdi
              userland driver (via libusb).  this is the reccommended and only
              currently supported interface.

NOTES:

string to identify your ftdi interface (pick one):
   d:devicenode (usually at /proc/bus/usb)
   i:vendor:product
   i:vendor:product:index
   s:vendor:product:serial
