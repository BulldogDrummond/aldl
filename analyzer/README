This is a utility to read log entries and make some sense out of them.

It is non-interactive, and simply performs logical analysis of the logs based
on various parameters.

It'll become more capable as time goes by...

To be completely honest, I've just written this peice of junk to analyze a few
problems that I've come up with.  It's probably inaccurate and riddled with
bugs, and I'm not very proud of how it's structured.  I just threw it together.

Use at your own risk...
