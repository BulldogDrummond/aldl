{"name":"Aldl","tagline":"A handler for gm obd-i aldl serial diagnostic systems.","body":"This is a program designed to manage aldl datastreams from the 8192 baud series of OBD-I GM ECMs.\r\n\r\nThe main goal is to turn small low-power linux devices such as the raspberry pi into a powerful auxiliary dashboard or perpetual datalogger:\r\n\r\n* Maintain stable diagnostic mode, with methods that are adaptable to all GM ECMs.\r\n* Low memory and CPU usage with pure optimized C\r\n* Portable to at least x86 and ARM\r\n* Parse multiple datastreams efficiently with maximum throughput allowable\r\n* Accurate unit conversions for all known data that are transparent to plugins\r\n* Stupid simple plug-in API that requires no knowledge of the datastream\r\n* Parallel processing of output plugins with a single serial input\r\n* Script to convert ADF format spec\r\n\r\nPossible plugins and applications for target devices include:\r\n\r\n- ncurses or GTK display interfaces for supplimental dashboards\r\n- lightweight multi-format dataloggers\r\n- warning buzzer or warning light widgets\r\n- simple scripting engines, which, combined with a GPIO header, could allow this to become a fairly capable piggyback ECM for boost control, cutout actuation, or whatever\r\n\r\nRight now it's in early stages, we're working on establishing reliable comms, but we're getting there, and would appreciate any help.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
