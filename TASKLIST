* list of shit that needs to get done in the short term *

- testing of generic tty serial mode (steve)
- thread scheduling routines for plugins (steve)
- debug mode aldl stream output plugin (need plugin api spec first) ...
- error handling api, design in tandem with plugin API.  we need plugins
  to be able to deal with non-fatal or temporary error conditions ..
- server status api (might be part of error handling lib)
